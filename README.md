# CI-CD with Dataflow

In this project, you set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for processing data by implementing CI/CD methods with managed products on Google Cloud. Data scientists and engineers can adapt the methodologies from CI/CD practices to help ensure the high quality, maintainability, and adaptability of data processes and workflows. The methods that you can apply are as follows:

* Version control of source code;

* Automatic building, testing, and deployment of apps;

* Environment isolation and separation from production;

* Replicable procedures for environment setup.

**NB**: The folder **ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow-master** contains source code for the guide on how to use Cloud Build and Cloud Composer to create a CI/CD pipeline for building, deployment and testing of a data processing workflow. The [code](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow) is available in the github of the Google Cloud Platform organization for viewer. Refer to the [solution guide](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/cicd-pipeline-for-data-processing) for the steps to run the code in the folder **ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow-master**.
