# CI-CD with Dataflow

In this project, you set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for processing data by implementing CI/CD methods with managed products on Google Cloud. Data scientists and engineers can adapt the methodologies from CI/CD practices to help ensure the high quality, maintainability, and adaptability of data processes and workflows. The methods that you can apply are as follows:

* Version control of source code;

* Automatic building, testing, and deployment of apps;

* Environment isolation and separation from production;

* Replicable procedures for environment setup.
